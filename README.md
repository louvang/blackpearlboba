# [Black Pearl Boba](https://louvang.github.io/blackpearlboba/)

A simple webpage for a restaurant/cafe.

## About Code

This webpage uses Webpack to bundle together modules. There are several modules I wrote in the `/src` directory that have been bundled into `main.js` using Webpack. The webpage only has 1 HTML file and loads content from the various modules based on which 'tab' (navigation link) has been linked.

## Thoughts

I have a better understanding of importing and exporting modules now. I can see a lot of what I did with this project in the previous projects I did with React. Prior to this, I jumped into React with only the basics of JavaScript under my belt. Now that I know more about modules, everything is starting to piece together much nicely and overall, makes much more sense.

Webpack is still a doozy for me but that is always the case for new languages, libraries, and frameworks. What I know is that webpack takes our input (src files) and outputs them to something more presentable (dist files).
